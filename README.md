# Welcome to MDDT

Hello, User! We introduce ourselves, we are MDDT, but...

## Who are we?

MDDT (also called **M*oderation* D*eveloper* D*esign* T*eam***) that only wants to publish or broadcast our products for free and publicly; moreover, we are a group developing products to improve their efficiency with certain tools.

Similarly, to solving problems that we encounter along the way due to limitations or errors that cause inefficiency (Clarification: this does not mean that they are **poorly designed** only that they do not provide the stable flexibility needed to help).

## What do we do?

MDDT (also called **M*oderation* D*eveloper* D*esign* T*eam***) only does projects according to **needs that we see** (us) or **difficulties that we see** (us) in **Java** (for now), to develop the products and assist them.

## Projects that we are active (doing):

- Material Components: https://github.com/GHMMDDTT/Material-Components
- Java Components: https://github.com/GHMMDDTT/Java-Components
- Cappuccino Language: https://github.com/GHMMDDTT/Cappuccino-Language
